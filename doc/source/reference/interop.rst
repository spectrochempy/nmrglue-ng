nmrglue.interop
===============

.. automodule:: nmrglue.interop

This module is imported as ``nmrglue.interop``.  It is an optional, additive
layer: the historical ``format.read() -> (dic, data)`` reader APIs are
unchanged, and no SpectroChemPy, NDDataset, Pint or CSDM dependency is
imported.  The first supported profile is Bruker/TopSpin processed 1D data.

Agilent 1D scan-count evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``read_agilent_fid`` and ``normalize_agilent_fid`` preserve decoded sample
values. They do not divide by scan counts or apply binary scale corrections.
The normalized storage profile is not a claim of physical amplitude calibration.

``result.acquisition['scan_counts']`` exposes:

* ``requested``: the scalar positive integer ``procpar.nt``, or ``None``;
* ``procpar_completed``: the scalar nonnegative integer ``procpar.ct``, or
  ``None``;
* ``block_completed`` and ``block_scales``: values from each parsed FID block;
* ``completed``: the count from a single valid block, only when the count
  evidence is valid and no known procpar count contradicts it;
* ``source``: ``fid.blockheader.ctcount`` when ``completed`` is known;
* ``status``: ``consistent``, ``block-only``, ``conflicting``, ``invalid``,
  ``ambiguous`` or ``unavailable``;
* ``invalid``: names of count fields that cannot be interpreted safely.

Malformed, negative, fractional or array-valued counts are not scalarized.
Zero is allowed for completed transients, not for requested transients.
Text counts are validated exactly, without an intermediate float rounding.
Requested ``nt`` is limited to the documented range 1 to 1e9; completed
counts must fit the nonnegative signed 32-bit block-counter range.
A completed count is not inferred from ``nt`` or from procpar alone. Missing or
multiple block headers leave it unknown. Inconsistent ``ct`` and ``ctcount``
are retained separately; ``completed`` and ``source`` are then ``None``.
Invalid count evidence also leaves ``completed`` unknown, even if another
field is valid. These states do not prevent raw sample reading.

Block headers are parsed even with the default ``read_blockhead=False``;
that option continues to control retention of the full headers in ``metadata``.
The existing ``NS`` and ``NE`` fields retain their literal ``ns``/``ne``
meaning; they are not silently replaced by ``nt`` or ``ctcount``.

This distinction follows the Agilent `VnmrJ 3.2 Command and Parameter Reference
<https://imserc.northwestern.edu/downloads/nmr-vj_cpr.pdf>`_ (printed pages
190 and 579): ``nt`` is requested, while ``ct`` describes completed transients
and can lag acquisition until processing. The binary definition in `VnmrJ
User Programming <https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/0199937900a.pdf>`_
(printed pages 275-276) associates ``ctcount`` with the individual FID.

Two hash-verified original 1D acquisitions have matching ``nt``, ``ct`` and
``ctcount`` values of 160 and 512, with block scale zero. Aborted acquisition,
conflicting counts and nonzero scale cases are synthetic regressions, not
additional real-acquisition validation. Receiver-gain correction, nonzero
binary scale restoration and physical amplitude normalization remain unqualified.

Normalized frequency-axis descriptor (experimental)
--------------------------------------------------

The optional ``NormalizedAcquisition.acquisition['frequency_axis']`` mapping
separates format interpretation from consumer processing. Schema
``normalized-frequency-axis-v1`` declares:

* ``bin_sign``: either -1 or +1, relative to the negative-exponent centered DFT;
* ``reference_frequency_mhz``: positive chemical-zero frequency, or ``None``;
* ``reference_enabled``: ``False`` disables reference application, ``True``
  permits it, and ``None`` means the source has no explicit enable flag;
* ``offsets_hz``: a mapping of opaque candidate labels to finite offsets.

For a selected offset ``c`` and width ``SW``, the physical frequency at bin
``i`` of a complete N-point DFT is
``c + bin_sign * (i - N//2) * SW/N``. Divide by the chemical-zero frequency in
MHz to obtain ppm. Consumers must select a candidate explicitly and must not
infer a convention from origin, profile name or raw vendor metadata.

The Agilent normalization profile declares sign -1. It exposes ``rfl-rfp`` as
``SW/2-rfl+rfp`` and ``sfrq-reffrq`` as ``(sfrq-reffrq)*1e6`` when evidence is
available. It uses ``reffrq`` for the chemical-zero frequency and permits the
explicit ``refpos=0`` flag; disabled or ambiguous flags disable referencing.
Missing flags remain unknown. This describes candidate evidence, not a choice
of experimentally correct chemical standard. The historical carbon acquisition
has conflicting candidates (0 versus 281.6 Hz), which remain separate.
The convention follows the VnmrJ reference equations and NMRPipe var2pipe sign
behavior qualified in the consumer's two-file numerical comparison. No FFT,
conjugation, scaling or reference is applied by normalization; the raw
``ReadResult`` remains unchanged. Existing normalized fields remain compatible.

The reference formulas are documented in the `VNMR Getting Started manual
<https://www2.chem.wisc.edu/~cic/nmr/Guides/Varian_VNMR_manuals/VNMR_Getting_Started--VNMR_6_1C_01-999160-00_rev_A0800--0199916000a.pdf>`_
and the `VnmrJ parameter reference
<https://imserc.northwestern.edu/downloads/nmr-vj_cpr.pdf>`_ (reffrq, rfl, rfp).

Arrayed ``rfl``, ``rfp``, ``reffrq`` or ``sfrq`` cannot establish a scalar
reference candidate. Multiple ``sw`` values are rejected by the normalized 1D
profile because they cannot establish one calibrated time grid. The raw reader
API remains unchanged.
